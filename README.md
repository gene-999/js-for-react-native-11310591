## Task 1

The `processArray` function in `arrayManipulation.js` takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2

The `formatArrayStrings` function in `arrayManipulation.js` takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number by capitalizing the entire string if the number is even or converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3

The `createUserProfiles` function in `userInfo.js` takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
